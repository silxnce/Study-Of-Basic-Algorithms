1. Find the 24th, 37th, 46th, and 111th prime numbers.
2. Write a function to convert a natural decimal number into a base-7 numeral system and another function for the reverse conversion. Test them with several examples.
3. Given a natural number N, find the maximum digit of this number using recursion (without using loops or string literals). For example, when N = 126, the program should output 6.

Also GitHub has some issues with Cyrillic symbols, therefore, some comments and lines of code may not be displayed correctly.
